# MazeExplorer
A program that plays a maze exploration game with the user.
This project was the final project in the CSE1223 Intro to Programming in Java course I took at Ohio State University. It involves two classes. The first one creates the maze, and performs the actions desired by the user. The other runs the game and allows the user to play it. Included with these two classes are also three txt files that contain the layouts for maps to play the game with. I received a 100% on this project.
